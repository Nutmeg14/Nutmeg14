- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nutmeg14
- 👀 I’m interested in science, rock climbing, creative writing, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. I have a little background on R and Python but am not actually competent in either yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects in the future potentially.
